 * Fired after an ACH contribution has been reversed (e.g. bank return / NSF).
 *
 * The reversal itself — cancelling the original contribution and letting core
 * unwind its financial items — is already done by the time this fires. This
 * event exists so a consumer can reverse its OWN records that hang off the
 * contribution and that core knows nothing about (soft credits by line item,
 * bill-to bridges, etc.).
 *
 * wasPaid tells a consumer whether real money had been recorded against the
 * original: if TRUE it should write an offsetting (negative) reversal so the
 * audit trail is preserved; if FALSE the original was only ever Pending, so the
 * related records can simply be removed.
